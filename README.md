# Profile Post Limits

This add-on allows you to control the limitations on profile posts that are hardcoded into the core.

## Features
* Change the profile post character limit, 140 by default (twitter style)
* Change the profile post message limits, 420 by default
* Change the profile post comment limits, 420 by default
* Change the profile post users tagged limits, unlimited by default
* Clean code to avoid interference with other add-ons as well as XF core (a bit less self explanatory when extending what we do)
* No performance impacts!
* No database changes!

## Installation
1. Unzip profilepostlimits-{version}.zip
2. Upload the contents of the upload directory to your XenForo installation
3. Install from uploaded file: Upload addon-aProfilePostLimit.xml

The add-on should now be installed, and a short rebuilding process should occur. Once done, the installation has been successful!

## Usage
Just set the necessary options in XenForo Options -> [A] Profile Post Limit
